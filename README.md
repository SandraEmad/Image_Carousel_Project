# 🎠 Image Carousel Project
This project is a simple and responsive Image Carousel (Slider) built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
Users can navigate through a set of images using previous (←) and next (→) buttons.

## 🚀 Features:
- Carousel with next/previous navigation
        
- Supports infinite looping (goes from last to first and vice versa)
        
- Clean structure using data attributes for easy JS targeting
        
- Lightweight and dependency-free (no frameworks)
        
- Simple and beginner-friendly
    
# 💡 How It Works
- Buttons are marked with data-carousel-button="next" or "prev".

- JavaScript listens for button clicks and moves the active slide.

- The slide is updated by manipulating the data-active attribute.
